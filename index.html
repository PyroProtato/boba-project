        <p>My first big project in pygame! Taught me the basics of using the library including how to create elements, how to make them interactive, and how to combine it with normal python calculations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built using Python and Pygame</li>
            <li>Over 100 Hours</li>
            <li>Demo: <a href="https://pyroprotato.itch.io/blackjack" target="_blank">Blackjack</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Second project in pygame. Introduced me more to classes in python in conjunction with pygame elements. During this project I also started making a large pygame reference file with a bunch of different classes that I can use later. Got me much more comfortable with the software.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built using Python and Pygame</li>
            <li>Around 25-30 Hours</li>

        <p>My biggest project so far! Originally made for a Game Jam at my school, but eventually I realized that I really liked the idea and continue to work on it. Adapted it heavily for the High Seas game jam and turned it into a high seas project as well. This game marked the point that I would consider myself to know the pygame library.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built using Python and Pygame</li>
            <li>Over 100 Hours</li>
            <li>Art made by IcePenguin000</li>
